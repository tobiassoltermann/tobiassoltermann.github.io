In case the device runs out of power, the power supply should be replaceable rather quickly.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A good choice for the electronics would be some Arduino-based device, attached to a commonly available NFC/RFID reader. Even though the device will not be capable to fully read contactless cards, it will at least be able to detect their presence.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I have first designed a circuit schema in <a href=\"https://www.kicad.org/\" target=\"_blank\">KiCad</a>.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/schema.png\" height=\"572\" width=\"1500\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/schema-xs.png 384w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/schema-sm.png 600w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/schema-md.png 768w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/schema-lg.png 1200w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/schema-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    To give the customer a visual draft, I also created a 3D model in <a href=\"https://www.sketchup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sketchup</a>.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/draft.png\" height=\"1010\" width=\"1500\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/draft-xs.png 384w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/draft-sm.png 600w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/draft-md.png 768w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/draft-lg.png 1200w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/3/responsive/draft-xl.png 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n    <h2 id=\"build-process\">\n      Build process\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The circuit is a s simple as it gets.

It is a traditional cards game in Switzerland. There’s probably an uncountable number of variants, but two of the most commonly played flavours are called <a href=\"https://www.swisslos.ch/en/jass/informations/jass-rules/coiffeur-jass.html\" target=\"_blank\">Coiffeur</a> and <a href=\"https://www.swisslos.ch/en/jass/informations/jass-rules/schieber-jass.html\" target=\"_blank\">Schieber</a>.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    During the rather extraordinary situation raised by COVID-19, playing such a game physically was obviously out of question. While on a video call with best friends we usually play this game with, we researched for a potential substitution of physical play. There were a few apps available for smartphones, but either they were not working reliably enough to play a serious game - or they were not designed for players knowing each other beforehands.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I decided to give it a go and build something by myself. Requirements were that it is a web-based solution working on modern browsers, and that it is playable on tablets and computers/laptops. <br><br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Developed with <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Node.JS</a>, <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ReactJS</a>.

Because they offer timber cutting services, employees are operating a vertical panel saw - which is very loud and calls on their portable phone go overheard.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This led to missed calls and I have been asked to find a solution - with a budget of CHF 100. The project aimed at providing a (dust-proof) visual indicator whenever the portable phone rings, so the operator could hear it even in noisy areas.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The device was built using a <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Raspberry Pi 1</a> and a relay shield. Coding of a custom-made SIP-stack and the service was done in <a href=\"http://golang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Go</a>.\n  </p>\n<div><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" data-responsive=\"false\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5C6CleBDbrY?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1\">\n</iframe></div>\n\n    <h1 id=\"details\">\n      Details\n    </h1>\n\n  <p>\n    The company I worked for operated a Cisco based telephony system.

They’re designed to attach legacy, analog devices (e.g. phones, fax) to a SIP-based <a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/PBX\" target=\"_blank\">PBX</a> like <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/unified-communications/unified-communications-manager-callmanager/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco Unified Communications Manager</a>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But creating a new service based on an out-of-date technology was not an option. Hence, I decided to design it myself.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"technical-stuff\">\n      Technical stuff\n    </h2>\n\n    <h3 id=\"hardware\">\n      Hardware\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    The hardware had to be cheap, but dust-proof and comply with electrical regulations.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/6/3768.jpg\" height=\"844\" width=\"1500\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/3768-xs.jpg 384w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/3768-sm.jpg 600w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/3768-md.jpg 768w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/3768-lg.jpg 1200w ,https://tobiassoltermann.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/3768-xl.jpg 1600w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    I ended up placing a Raspberry Pi 1 single board computer in an electrical box and attaching a Relay shield (4 channels to potentially allow future expansion) to it using the provided <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/\" target=\"_blank\">GPIO</a> pins.<br><br>As the light indicator was based on a 230V powered garden light, a high-voltage connection was needed in the box anyway. Therefore, it could be used to power the board as well using an USB power cable.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"software\">\n      Software\n    </h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Some software was needed to use the relay shield whenever a call comes in. Besides Linux as an operating system, some more components were required. I always wanted to play around with Google’s fairly new Go programming language. The device was built and tested for <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/unified-communications/unified-communications-manager-callmanager/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco CallManager</a> 8.6.2 but could be connected to any SIP-based PBX.\n  </p>\n\n    <h4 id=\"sip-stack\">\n      SIP Stack\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    At the time, no proper SIP stack existed for Go, I had to build the necessary parts on my own. The resulting library is far away from complete, but handles call setup and call teardown very reliably. Usage is fairly simple:\n  </p>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-go\"><code>// Register:\ns = sip.CreateClient()\ns.SetDefaultTransport(appconfig.Transport)\nr := sip.RegisterInfo{\n\tsip.Connectinfo{\n\t\tappconfig.Transport,\n\t\tappconfig.ProxyIP,\n\t\tappconfig.ProxyPort,\n\t},\n\tsip.Connectinfo{\n\t\tappconfig.Transport,\n\t\tGetOutboundIP(proxyIP),\n\t\tappconfig.LocalPort,\n\t},\n\tappconfig.Phonenumber,\n\tsip.DigestUserInfo(\n\t\tappconfig.Username,\n\t\tappconfig.Password\n\t),\n\t0,\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"line-numbers  language-go\"><code>// Accept calls:\ns.OnIncomingCall(func(call *sip.Call) {\n\tlog.Println(\"Incoming Call\")\n})\ns.OnCancel(func(call *sip.Call) {\n\tlog.Println(\"Cancel existing call\")\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n  <p>\n    The library is open-source (free for everyone to use) and can be found on a <a href=\"https://github.com/tobiassoltermann/sip\" target=\"_blank\">Github repository</a>. Also, the application code is on another one found <a href=\"https://github.com/tobiassoltermann/sipbell\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The configuration is done using a <a href=\"https://www.json.org/\" target=\"_blank\">JSON</a> file, an <a href=\"https://github.com/tobiassoltermann/sipbell/blob/master/config.json.example\" target=\"_blank\">example</a> can be found in the repository.<br><br>In Cisco Unified Communications Manager, the device is configured as <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/admin/11_0_1/sysConfig/CUCM_BK_C733E983_00_cucm-system-configuration-guide-1101/Configure___Third_Party_SIP_Phones.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Third-Party SIP Device (Basic)</a>, attached to the actual portable phone using a Shared Line.
